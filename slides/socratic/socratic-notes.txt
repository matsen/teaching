# introductions:

* let's introduce ourselves
* my name is Erick, my pronouns are he/him but I'm perfectly happy being addressed with gender-neutral pronouns.
* I'm a professor ...
* tell me about your research interests

# we can use trees to represent relationships, but this is not a phylogenetic tree
let's draw a tree...
introduce terminology: internal nodes, tip nodes or leaves, sisters, edge/branch

# let's draw a tree on these shapes.
can map character changes to branches

# internal nodes have a specific meaning, which differs between biological contexts
let's throw out some names of organisms
what does this internal node mean?
where is ... <some organism that isn't there> ...

does the horizontal dimension mean anything?
what do the lengths of branches mean?
can we assign calendar dates?

now let's say that we are building a tree of virus sequences.
what do internal nodes mean then?

# trees represent a _sampled_ set of tips, and different sampling schemes can give us different pictures of history and the evolutionary process
<reveal the left part of the SARS-CoV-2 diagram first>
what happens if a novel variant arises in India, isn't sampled, and then is transmitted to the UK?

# reading phylogenetic trees takes practice, and it's easy to be misled
"mainline" artifact, reading across the tips, reading trends into shape

# it can be difficult to learn the root of the tree
here are a few DNA sequences
shall we draw a tree on these?

# to build an informative molecular phylogeny, we need mutations
multifurcation could be resolved one of several ways

# some branches can have more mutations than others
this _may_ indicate that more time has passed

# phylogenetic reconstruction isn't "obvious" and the results should use biological understanding
homoplasy
what if this is a protein-coding gene?

# ... con't ...
what if this is an intron

# substitution rate variation
*** rare mutations should be weighed more heavily than common mutations ***

# TS/TV
how could we bring this type of thing in to phylogenetic inference?

# we need to establish homology relationships between sites to be able to do phylogeny; this is done for molecular data using multiple sequence alignment
that's a hard problem

# phylogeny happens on the level of genes. what if there is gene duplication and loss? incomplete lineage sorting?
start by drawing a single simply branching tree inside the species tree
then talk about ILS
then talk about duplication and loss

# we need to use tools to assess confidence in phylogeny, AND we need to look at the data and be critical of it
Look at sample.fasta
