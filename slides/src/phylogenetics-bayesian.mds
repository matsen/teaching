Modern technology gives us the ability to *observe* in great detail, which is wonderful, but in order to actually gain understanding we need to simplify and abstract.

But very detailed observation is not the same as understanding
^imgw figures/inference/edge-detection.jpg

To *understand* we need to simplify and abstract.


# What abstractions do we have at our disposal?

<aside class="notes">
* Here is the number 3, which is one abstraction we all know and love.
* This is such a basic abstraction that sometimes we forget that it's an abstraction at all.
* But it really is-- you can't have "three" in your pocket.
* You can have three coins, three pipette tips or three wombats in your pocket, but you can't have "three".
* I think we can all agree that conducting science without the letter 3 and its ilk would be rather difficult.

So now I'm going to skip over the square root of 2 and the completely bizarre notion of negative numbers to $x$.

<section data-background="figures/inference/abstraction-x_nofonts.svg"> </section>

<aside class="notes">
* $x$ is like 3 in that it represents an abstract quantity, but in the case of $x$ it's an unknown abstract quantity.
* $x$ is SO COOL.
* $x$ is SO COOL because it allows us to describe knowledge in an implicit way.
</aside>


# $x$ is useful and we love it dearly!

&nbsp;

$x$ allows us to describe knowledge in an implicit way:

&nbsp;

$$
f(x)=y
$$

&nbsp;

then we can work towards *solving* for $x$.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<div class="fragment">
Alternatively, one might be interested in taking the average of a $g(x)$ between two values $a$ and $b$.
</div>

<aside class="notes">
* For example, here we have $x$
* $x$ is SO COOL.
* It allows us to describe knowledge in an implicit way.

# $1/(b-a) \cdot \int_a^b g(x) \ dx$ is average

# Variables allow us to solve
^imgw figures/inference/cannon-deterministic.svg

* *Problem 1*: given $y$, solve for $x$.
* *Problem 2*: predict if a 10% bigger charge will hit the castle. <br> Say the answer to this is $\text{hit}_{10}(x)$, such that $\text{hit}_{10}(x)$ is 1 if that $x$ will make the cannonball hit the castle, and 0 otherwise.

<aside class="notes">
* I will leave the actual solution as an exercise.
* But actually I would like to use this toy problem as a way to point out that normal sorts of variables only allow us to solve...
</aside>


# Variables allow us to solve

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

... in a *deterministic* framework.

<aside class="notes">
* This implicitly assumes that not only does the process happen in exactly the same way each time, it also means that we have a complete description of the process.
* Given x, the cannonball is going to take exactly the same trajectory each time.
* No variation in wind, no strange turbulence effects with slightly different shaped cannonballs, no anything that might make the path do anything other than strict Newtonian motion.
* So here is a picture of something that inhabits this world:

Life is a probabilistic process.

How do we abstract probabilistic quantities?

Random variables are capricious, <br> but they are well defined behind their stochastic exterior.

Random variables are defined according to their distribution.

# Working with *random variables* $X$:
&nbsp;

<div class="fragment">
We can solve for $X$ in "equations" like
$f(X) \sim Y$, obtaining expressions such as $\mathbb P(X \mid Y);$
this is called *inference*.
</div>

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<div class="fragment">
We can also *average* with respect to $X$:

$$
\int g(X) \, d\mathbb P(X \mid Y)
$$

where now we are averaging out with respect to a probability.
</div>


# Probabilistic approach to prediction
^imgw figures/inference/cannon-probabilistic.svg

* $Y$: horizontal distance traveled by a cannonball (random variable)
* $X$: cannon angle (inferred random variable)
* *Problem 1*: given observed distribution $Y$, infer distribution of $X$.
* *Problem 2*: find probability that a 10% bigger charge will hit castle.

&nbsp;

1. Solve $f(X) \sim Y$ &nbsp; to get &nbsp; $\mathbb P(X \mid Y)$.
2. Integrate $\int \text{hit}_{10}(X) \, d\mathbb P(X \mid Y)$.


# Biological experiments are measurements with uncertainty

# Model-based statistical inference <span style="color:green"> ✓ </span>
&nbsp;

We can solve for $X$ in "equations" like $f(X) \sim Y$, <br>
*inferring* an unknown distribution for $X$ <br>
(what can we learn about the angle of the cannon).

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<div class="fragment">
We can push uncertainty through an analysis using integrals like
$$
\int_a^b g(X) \, d\mathbb P(X \mid Y).
$$
(we don't care what the angle of the cannon is really, we just want to know with what probability the shot is going to hit the castle!)

# [Bayes theorem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem)

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

$$
P(X \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid X) P(X)}{P(D)}
$$

&nbsp;

$$
P(D) = \sum_{X} P(D \mid X) P(X)
$$

# Motivation: we would like to decide whether an individual has been *superinfected*, i.e. infected with a second viral variant in a separate event

# Integrate out phylogenetic uncertainty
<!--

To decide superinfection, we would like to calculate
$$
\int_S g(T) \, d\mathbb P(T \mid Y)
$$
where $T$ is now a *phylogenetic-tree-valued random variable*.

<div class="fragment">
If we can sample from the posterior distribution $P(T \mid Y)$ of trees given data, then
$$
\int_S g(T) \, d\mathbb P(T \mid Y) = \sum_{T \sim P(T \mid Y)} g(T)

# Why is random-walk Markov chain Monte Carlo so slow?

The efficiency of MCMC depends on the fraction of good neighbors.
