let's draw a tree...
someone throw out some musicians or bands that everyone here might know
what kind of tree is that?
what do internal nodes mean?

let's throw out some names of organisms
what does this internal node mean?
where is ... <some organism that isn't there> ...

# it can be difficult to learn the root of the tree
here are a few DNA sequences
shall we draw a tree on these?

# to build an informative molecular phylogeny, we need mutations
multifurcation could be resolved one of several ways


# mutation rates can vary across the tree and this makes it challenging to assign calendar dates


# phylogenetic reconstruction isn't "obvious" and the results should use biological understanding
homoplasy
what if this is a protein-coding gene?

# ... con't ...
what if this is an intron
TS/TV
*** rare mutations should be weighed more heavily than common mutations ***

<to the right> substitution rate variation


# we need to establish homology relationships between sites to be able to do phylogeny; this is done for molecular data using multiple sequence alignment
that's a hard problem


# what if there is gene duplication and loss?


# we need to use tools to assess confidence in phylogeny, AND we need to look at the data and be critical of it
Look at sample.fasta
